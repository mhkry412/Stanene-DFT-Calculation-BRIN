It is freely available to researchers around the world under the terms of the GNU General Public License. QUANTUM ESPRESSO builds upon newly-restructured electronic-structure codes that have been developed and tested by some of the original authors of novel electronic-structure algorithms and applied in the last twenty years by some of the leading materials modeling groups worldwide. Innovation and efficiency are still its main focus, with special attention paid to massively parallel architectures, and a great effort being devoted to user friendliness. QUANTUM ESPRESSO is evolving towards a distribution of independent and interoperable codes in the spirit of an open-source project, where researchers active in the field of electronic-structure calculations are encouraged to participate in the project by contributing their own codes or by implementing their own ideas into existing codes.}

abstract  ="The effect of a MoS2 substrate on the structural and electronic properties of stanene were systematically investigated by first-principles calculations. The Brillouin zone of isolated stanene has a Dirac cone at the K point. MoS2 helps to open an energy gap at the K point{,} whereas contributes no additional transport channels near the Fermi level. Our results suggest that the carrier mobility remains large{,} which makes the stanene/MoS2 heterostructure a competitive material for electronic applications. Subsequently{,} strain engineering study by changing the interlayer spacing between stanene and MoS2 layer and changing lattice constants indicates that the energy gap at K point can be effectively tuned to meet the demands of experiments and device design in nanoelectronics. Moreover{,} a large enough strain leads to a metal–semiconductor phase transition to make the intrinsic semiconductor turn into self-doping phase. Our study indicates that MoS2 is a good substrate to promote the development of Sn-based nanoelectronics."}

We describe a ladder of approximations for the exchange-correlation energy as a functional of the electron density. At the lowest rung of this ladder, the contribution to the energy from a volume element of 3-dimensional space is determined by the local density there. Higher rungs or levels incorporate increasingly complex ingredients constructed from the density or the Kohn-Sham orbitals in or around this volume element. We identify which additional exact conditions can be satisfied at each level, and discuss the extent to which the functionals at each level may be constructed without empirical input. We also discuss the research that remains to be done at the exact-exchange level, and present our “dreams of a final theory.” “Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it.”}",
